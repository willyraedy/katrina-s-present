          <p>Good morning beautiful! I wish I could be there with you today! I'll be there in <a href='https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20170701T0030&p0=12&msg=Birthday+Celebration+%26+I+Get+to+See+You%21%21%21%21&ud=1&font=hand'>two weeks, four days, 14 hours, 57 minutes, and 22 seconds as of this writing.</a> I'm super excited about your present and I kinda want to tell you what it is but I'll wait until I see you! I did finish Americanah (finally) so I'm gonna ship that to you today. I can't wait to hear what you think about it. I was hoping to have it arrive today so I'm sorry you won't get it on your birthday.</p>
          <p>Rose, bud, thorn last night really reminded me of all the wonderful memories we've made this past year. I'm so glad I moved to Phoenix. Things just always seem better when we're together. I love you so much! I hope you have a great birthday and I can't wait to see you so we can make some more memories! </p>
          <p>Mwah, <p/>
          <p>Willibald </p>
          <p> P.S. Part of your birthday present is that I've decided I like the Willibald nickname haha</p>
